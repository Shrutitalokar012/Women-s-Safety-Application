Here, we made a small application by using android language.This application is different from other application.
Our app contaion three main basic features🔔 Shake to Alert
When the user shakes the phone, the app automatically sends an emergency alert to pre-saved contacts with location.
▶️ Right Side Button
A quick-access button on the app that instantly sends an emergency alert when pressed, without unlocking the phone.
🎤 Voice Detection
This funtion is very usefull and important because in some cases we doesn't have phone at that time it is usefull
Listens for keywords like "Help" or "Emergency" and instantly triggers an alert with the current location.
our app also send messages and our current location to the contacts which we already saved
Thank you..!!
